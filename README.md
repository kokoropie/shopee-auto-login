## üí≠About

Genshin Impact is the only game I have seen where the game itself is separated from the check-in benefits. Players need to download the MiHoYo App to check-in.

In fact, you can choose to ignore the sign-in, and there is no big loss if you don't sign in; or you can choose to sign-in manually, but in this case, it will be a headache to forget to check in.
##  üí°Characteristic

- [x] **Automatic sign-in**  The program will automatically execute the sign-in process every morning, or you can go through the deployment tutorial at any time`Step 4`Manual trigger, refer to specific time [Here](.github/workflows/main-os.yml)
- [x] **Support synchronization**  Automatic synchronization of upstream warehouses, closed by default
- [x] **Support notification**   Multiple notification methods can be selected, which can be turned on by configuring different parameters, and the check-in results will be pushed to subscribers every day
- [x] **Support multiple accounts**  Different accounts`Cookie`Use between values`#`Separated, such as:`Cookie1#Cookie2#Cookie3`
- [x] **Supports multiple roles**  Supports MiHoYo accounts that bind official service and channel service roles

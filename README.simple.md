## üí≠About

Genshin Impact is the only game I have seen where the game itself is separated from the check-in benefits. Players need to download the MiHoYo App to check-in.

In fact, you can choose to ignore the sign-in, and there is no big loss if you don't sign in; or you can choose to sign-in manually, but in this case, it will be a headache to forget to check in.

## üìêDeploy

- Fork Project
- Get Cookie
- Add Cookie to Secrets
- Enable Actions
- Multiple Accounts

## :warning:User Ô∏èAgreement

Using Genshin Impact Auto Login means that you know and agree to:

- This code uses cookies to log in to the Miyoushe webpage through a simulated browser, and click the page to complete the sign-in to realize the sign-in. The function is implemented through the official public API, not a game plug-in
- The user's cookie is stored on the Github server and is only used for this project. If the Github server is compromised, your cookies are at risk of being leaked. In addition, the developer has no right to obtain your cookie; even the user, once created Secrets, cannot view the cookie from it again
- Genshin Impact Auto Login will not be responsible for any of your losses, including but not limited to reward recovery, abnormal account, cutting off, mining of minerals, nuclear bomb explosion, World War III, etc.
